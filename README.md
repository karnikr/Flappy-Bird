# Flappy-Bird

This code implements a Flappy Bird game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm
The game features a bird that the player controls to avoid pipes, with the help of a neural network that learns to play the game
The NEAT algorithm evolves the neural networks over generations
